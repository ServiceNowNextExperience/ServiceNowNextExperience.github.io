## Overview
In this activity, you will update the UX List Categories and UX Lists for the Service Operations Workspace. 

## Instructions

1. In the related lists, you’ll see 9 UX List Categories and the 37 UX Lists. We can see the order of the Categories by looking at the Order column.  First, let’s focus on reordering the categories so that “Incidents” falls between “Interactions” and “Requests”.

2. From the list, double-click on the “Order” field for the **Incidents** record.

3. Type “75” and save by clicking the checkbox or hitting “enter”. This will cause it to land just below Interactions but above Requests.
