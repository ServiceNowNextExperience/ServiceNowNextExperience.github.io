## Scenario
A common request customers may have is to update the out-of-box lists that appear in the menu in a Workspace. 

In this exercise, we’re going to walk through a scenario where a customer has asked you to help them re-arrange the categories of the lists and add a brand new list to their Service Operations Workspace experience. 

The customer wants this list to always be grouped by the incident’s state, always display the checkboxes (instead of only on hover), wants to display reference field links as read-only, and hide pagination. They also don’t want to allow their users to drag-and-drop list rows.
