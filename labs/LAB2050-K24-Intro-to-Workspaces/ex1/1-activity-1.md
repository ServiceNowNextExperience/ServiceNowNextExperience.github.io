Let’s quickly explain what you are looking at:
    -	Audiences: These are representations of groups of users in your organizations. These let you define who has access to these pages, If you leave it blank anyone with access to the page will have access to the variant. 
    -	Conditions: These can be used to determine when a page variant is shown. Conditions are based on adding a query string that sets the criteria that must be met for the page variant to display. 
10.	Rename the variant to “K24 Lab Landing Page” and click **Create**.
