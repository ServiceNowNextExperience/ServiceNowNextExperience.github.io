## Scenario

As an Administrator working for a ServiceNow customer or partner, you may often be asked to perform several modifications to OOB ServiceNow Workspaces. We are going to walk through a few changes you can easily perform to a workspace, using the HR Agent Workspace as our first example.

The default landing page greets the user at the top and provides the time, along with a heading describing what the user is seeing. There is an Overview section and a section showing Open items for my Team. We have received a few requests for modifications from the HR team:
-	Move the Open Items section from the bottom to above the Overview section
-	Remove the background image from the header
-	Add a Data Visualization to the header to show my cases

We will walk through the steps required to make these modifications.
