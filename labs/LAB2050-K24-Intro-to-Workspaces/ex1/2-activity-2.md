:::note
Alternatively, you can also drag and drop items in the Component tree itself. Locate the “Open items container” in the list, collapse the “Overview container” above it by clicking on the arrow to the left, and then click, drag & drop the “Open items container” heading above the “Overview container”. You will see the stage to the right update in real time when you let go of the heading.
