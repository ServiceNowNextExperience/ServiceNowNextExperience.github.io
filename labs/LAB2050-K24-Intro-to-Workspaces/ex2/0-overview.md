## Scenario

As an Administrator working for a ServiceNow customer or partner, you may often be asked to perform several modifications to OOB ServiceNow Workspaces. We are going to walk through a few changes you can easily perform to a workspace, continuing to use the HR Agent Workspace from our first example.

In this exercise we are going to go through the steps required to create a new Platform Analytics dashboard, create a page for it in our workspace, then create a new button in the left-hand L1 menu to provide easy navigation for our end users.

We will walk through the steps required to make these modifications.
