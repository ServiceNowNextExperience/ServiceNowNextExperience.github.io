## Introduction

There are many changes you can make to a theme that are not currently supported in Theme Builder. You are able to make these changes directly to the theming record using the forms & lists view of the platform, but it's important to note that any changes made outside of theme builder will not be synced over and if you make further changes to the theme inside of Theme Builder, all of your manual changes will be overridden.

It's for this reason that we will clone the theme we created in Theme Builder and then edit the new record outside of Theme Builder to make our custom theme align closer to our branding requirements.

There is an extra record we will not clone, which is the ___ record. This is what tells Theme Builder whether a theme was created inside of it, and therefore whether it is editable by Theme Builder or not. This means our new cloned theme will not be editable in theme Builder and we can avoid any issues in the future where our changes might be accidentally overridden.

In this exercise we will:

- Clone the UX Theme record and create new UX Style records
    
- Prepare UX Style record "Color" for editing
    
- Fix Unified Navigation background color
    
- Remove Opacity from the Unified Navigation menus and remove the polaris background image
    

Note: When creating a new theme, you can choose not to clone an existing theme at all and instead attempt to start from scratch if you'd like. I would discourage this as it is much easier to just start from a cloned theme. You can also optionally start from the Polaris theme if you'd like.
